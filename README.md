## Overview
The Outcome Mapping Tool is developed to simplify and automate the process of aligning COs with POs. This system is particularly useful in institutions that follow Outcome-Based Education (OBE) frameworks. By leveraging modern web technologies and data-driven algorithms, this tool ensures accurate and efficient CO-PO mappings, ultimately supporting better educational outcomes and program evaluations.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for faculty members to protect sensitive data.
- **Upload Functionality**: Faculty can upload Excel templates containing student marks and CO data.
- **Automated Mapping**: The system automatically maps COs to POs based on the uploaded data using sophisticated algorithms.
- **Feedback Section**: A section for faculty to provide feedback and suggestions for system improvement.
- **Download Capability**: Faculty can download the mapped data in an Excel format.
- **Notification System**: Faculty are notified upon completion of the CO-PO mapping process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface designed for faculty members.
